# Digital Agency Plugins

Claude and Cursor plugins and Managed Agent templates for digital agency workflows. Each named agent ships two ways from one source.

```

Run `python3 scripts/sync-agent-skills.py` after editing a skill under `skills/` — it propagates bundled copies into every agent under `agents/` that uses that skill. **Edit skills in `skills/`**, not in agent bundles.

Run `python3 scripts/validate.py` before opening a PR — it lints marketplace and plugin manifests, checks MCP connector wiring, validates SKILL.md frontmatter, resolves markdown cross-references, detects bundled-skill drift against `skills/`, and validates `evals/` JSON schema. Use `--format json` for CI; `--strict` once skills ship full agency-framework frontmatter. CI runs the same check on every PR via `.github/workflows/validate.yml`. Install the local pre-commit hook with `scripts/install-git-hooks.sh`. A `version-bump` GitHub Action (coming soon) will patch-bump each plugin's `plugin.json` `version` so a branch ends up exactly one patch ahead of `main`.

## Agents (current roster)

| Slug | Practice | Bundled skills | Status |
| ---- | -------- | -------------- | ------ |
| `frontend-engineer` | Engineering | `implement`, `code-review`, `create-mr`, `brand-guide`, `component-scaffold` (agent-local) | Shipped; not yet operationally proven |
| `senior-frontend-engineer` | Engineering | `code-review`, `design` | Shipped; not yet operationally proven |
| `product-manager` | Product | All 13 product-management skills (`product`, `roadmap`, `backlog`, `tasks`, `sprint`, `validate`, `write-spec`, `stakeholder-update`, `synthesize-research`, `competitive-brief`, `metrics-review`, `product-brainstorming`, `skills-index`) | Shipped; not yet operationally proven |
| `principal-frontend-engineer` | Engineering | `final-code-review`, `code-review`, `design`, `validate` | Shipped; not yet operationally proven |
| `qa-engineer` | Engineering | `deploy-qa`, `run-automated-suite`, `exploratory-pass`, `document-defects` | Shipped; not yet operationally proven |
| `delivery-lead` | Operations (cross-cutting) | `skills-index`, `backlog`, `tasks`, `sprint`, `validate`, `stakeholder-update`, `metrics-review` | Shipped; not yet operationally proven |
| `principal-architect` | Engineering (Architecture) | `solution`, `adr`, `design`, `docs` | Shipped; not yet operationally proven |

Each agent lives under `agents/<slug>/` with a canonical system prompt at `agents/<slug>.md`, bundled skills at `skills/`, and role-specific MCP in `.mcp.json`. Register new agents in both marketplace manifests.

## Local maintainer tooling (`.agents/`)

Repo-local skill quality tooling and crew runtime config for contributors — not published as a marketplace plugin:

| Component | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| **config** (`.agents/config`) | Steering doc paths and work directory for this repo |
| **steering** (`.agents/steering/`) | Strategy, solution, roadmap, backlog for this repository (gitignored) |
| **plugin-eval** (`.agents/skills/plugin-eval/SKILL.md`) | Live eval sessions — grade assertions in `evals/evals.json` |
| **skills-qa** (`.agents/skills/skills-qa/SKILL.md`) | Evaluate a skill against the Agency Skill Design Framework before shipping |

## Key Files

- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` / `.cursor-plugin/marketplace.json`: Marketplace manifests — register all plugins with source paths
- `plugin.json`: Plugin metadata — name, description, version, and component discovery settings
- `commands/*.md`: Slash commands invoked as `/plugin:command-name`
- `skills/*/SKILL.md`: Detailed knowledge and workflows for specific tasks
- `connectors/<slug>/.mcp.json`: Canonical MCP connector definitions (GitHub, GitLab, Vercel, Figma, Linear, Playwright, Context7, Next.js DevTools)
- `scripts/validate.py`: Structural validation — run before every PR
- `*.local.md`: User-specific configuration (gitignored)

## Development Workflow

1. Edit markdown files directly — changes take effect immediately
2. After skill changes under `skills/`, run `python3 scripts/sync-agent-skills.py`
3. Run `python3 scripts/validate.py` — fix errors before pushing
4. Test commands with `/plugin:command-name` syntax (Cowork) or install via Cursor Settings → Plugins
5. Skills are invoked automatically when their trigger conditions match
