# Digital Agency Plugins

Cowork and Cursor plugins and Claude Managed Agent templates for digital agency workflows. Each named agent ships two ways from one source.

```

Run `python3 scripts/sync-agent-skills.py` after editing a skill under `plugins/skills/` — it propagates bundled copies into every agent under `plugins/agents/` that uses that skill. **Edit skills in `plugins/skills/`**, not in agent bundles.

`check.py` (coming soon) will lint every manifest, verify all cross-file references resolve, and fail if any `agents/<slug>/skills/` copy has drifted from its `plugins/skills/` source. A pre-commit hook and `version-bump` GitHub Action (coming soon) will patch-bump each plugin's `plugin.json` `version` so a branch ends up exactly one patch ahead of `main`.

## Agents (current roster)

| Slug | Practice | Bundled skills | Status |
| ---- | -------- | -------------- | ------ |
| `frontend-engineer` | Engineering | `implement`, `code-review`, `create-mr`, `brand-guide`, `component-scaffold` (agent-local) | Shipped; not yet operationally proven |
| `senior-frontend-engineer` | Engineering | `code-review`, `design` | Shipped; not yet operationally proven |
| `product-manager` | Product | All 13 product-management skills (`product`, `roadmap`, `backlog`, `tasks`, `sprint`, `validate`, `write-spec`, `stakeholder-update`, `synthesize-research`, `competitive-brief`, `metrics-review`, `product-brainstorming`, `skills-index`) | Shipped; not yet operationally proven |
| `principal-frontend-engineer` | Engineering | `final-code-review`, `code-review`, `design`, `validate` | Shipped; not yet operationally proven |

Each agent lives under `plugins/agents/<slug>/` with a canonical system prompt at `agents/<slug>.md`, bundled skills at `skills/`, and role-specific MCP in `.mcp.json`. Register new agents in both marketplace manifests.

## Agency Builder Hub

Meta-tooling for skill quality lives at `agency-builder-hub/` (repo root, same pattern as `strategy-builder-hub` and `legal-builder-hub`):

| Component | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| **eval-grader** (`agency-builder-hub/agents/eval-grader.md`) | Grade eval batch output against `evals/evals.json` |
| **skills-qa** | Evaluate a skill against the Agency Skill Design Framework before shipping |

Community registry browse, install, and auto-update are deferred until more practices are operationally proven.

## Key Files

- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` / `.cursor-plugin/marketplace.json`: Marketplace manifests — register all plugins with source paths
- `plugin.json`: Plugin metadata — name, description, version, and component discovery settings
- `commands/*.md`: Slash commands invoked as `/plugin:command-name`
- `skills/*/SKILL.md`: Detailed knowledge and workflows for specific tasks
- `plugins/connectors/<slug>/.mcp.json`: Canonical MCP connector definitions (GitHub, GitLab, Vercel, Figma, Linear, Playwright, Context7, Next.js DevTools)
- `*.local.md`: User-specific configuration (gitignored)

## Development Workflow

1. Edit markdown files directly — changes take effect immediately
2. Test commands with `/plugin:command-name` syntax (Cowork) or install via Cursor Settings → Plugins
3. Skills are invoked automatically when their trigger conditions match
